# Project_Decoder_Ring_1
## Thinkful Module 12

 Project Decoder Ring is part of the curriculum for Software Engineering at Thinkful.  This is my final version, based on the instructions and grading rubric that was provided to me.  
 
 The project has three different algorithms that can encode and decode:
 * Ceasar Shift
 * Polybius Square 
 * Substitiution Cyper
 
 ### CEASAR SHIFT
 This algorithm will shift letters by the given number.  
 
 ### POLYBIUS SQUARE
 This algorithm will transfer letters into numbers and vice versa.  
 
 ### SUBSTITUTION CYPER
 This algorithm uses a regular alphabet as well as a given "key" alphabet.
